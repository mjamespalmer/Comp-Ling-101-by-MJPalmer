# Comp-Ling-101-by-MJPalmer
This is an informal teaching space for the eponymous linguist, graduated from UMass Amherst Linguistics as an undergraduate in May 2018. The intent of this repository is to teach interested personal parties the foundations of basic Python as well as the linguistic theory behind many of the practices in computational linguistics. These materials are freely available with credit to whomever wants to use them in any educational or leisure setting, but the author disavows themself of any expertise or warranty. This repository has been made public because the author is a cheapass.
